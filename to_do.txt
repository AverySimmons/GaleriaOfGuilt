all scene transitions (what should these look like?)
sounds effect implemented
make levels work
change enemy spawning logic
cooldown for abilities more visible
shotgun looks a little weird
make it more obvious when the player is hit (screen flash / hit pause?)
dialogic scene with walkie talkies / font
finalize upgrade text
I want to add controller support but I don't have a controller

THINK OF A TITLE

sprites / shaders needed:
enemy spawn sprite (unsure this is def a style thing)
door locked sprite (maybe just big red X)
main entrance sprite (could also just recolor it)
main menu
ending scene
