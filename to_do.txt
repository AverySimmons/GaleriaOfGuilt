all scene transitions (what should these look like?)
finalize upgrade text
I want to add controller support but I don't have a controller

adjust lots of values
player values
special ability values
enemy values
upgrade values
spawning values / level size

upgrade reworks:
general feeling is that blood gain is hard to notice, but maybe thats okay
things that give increased blood feel less powerful then getting something more
direct like an ability upgrade
endless void: a little hard to feel the draining difference but I think its good
easy prey: really fun to go for and difference is noticable but feels a little weak
smell of prey: good but should def give more blood and should probably say "unexplored" instead of new
insaitiable appetite: like other blood upgrades its a little hard to feel the change but I think its good
destructive haste: has a less cool fantasy then the other upgrades bc it has no synergy with anything but its okay
free lunch blah blah blah: really good, you can feel the dash distance
sentient wounds: really good, makes all the "get more blood" upgrades feel like they have a pay off
blood infused claws: I think we should have more damage increases, but this one is way too weak, and once again it feels like anti-syergy to lose the blood
bloodlust: really fun - has natural synergy with having high blood bc of the attack speed
explosive blood: incredibly broken has super low cooldown, does 2 hits, fills blood to full constantly, I pick this up and never slash again
bloodbath: im unsure how much this decreases the special cooldown so im always a little scared to pick it, but I like the fantasy
hungry claws: pretty simple, feels a little nothing burger, but I dont hate it
seeing red: another high risk high reward upgrade, we have 4 of these which might be a little too much, but I like this one too
reckless restless: pretty much a direct downgrade, I like the idea of this but I never pick it bc dash cooldown is already low
body of thorns: I love all the dash through enemy upgrades, this one the most, could maybe use some dash length
monsturus tenacity: really fun upgrade, kinda has anti-synergy with all the dash upgrades, but by itself its one of the most fun
rapid jaws: the tradeoff feels hard to understand, like the two things are so disconnected it feels hard to know if I should pick it or not
retractable claws: just a fun upgrade that feels like it has synergy with blood and is fun by itself
I NEED BLOOD: I never pick this, I always want my special and dont care about blood so much
vomit: fun to use, but def way worse then bite and grenade, tbh I think this should be the powerlevel of a special
engulfing maw: pretty broken, gives an insane amount of blood and does 2 hits of damage, all on a giant hitbox that lingers
vampiric frenzy: again we have 4 of these glass cannon ones which feels like a lot, this one is my least favorite bc getting more blood doesnt feel noticable
