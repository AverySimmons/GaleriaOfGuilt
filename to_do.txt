all scene transitions (what should these look like?)
finalize upgrade text
I want to add controller support but I don't have a controller

adjust lots of values
special ability values
upgrade values
spawning values / level size

## swipe:

costs_blood_more_dmg:
	swapped into while above 50% blood slashing costs a lot of blood, but deals more damage
lower_hp_swipe_lifesteal:
	perfect
more_blood_swipe:
	perfect
third_slash_more_dmg:
	perfect

wanted upgrades:
 - slashing enemies decreases special cooldown

## special:

lower_spcd_lower_bg:
	swapped into lower special cooldown, costs 15% blood
more_blood_more_cd:
	perfect
special_cd_red_health:
	perfect

wanted upgrades:
 - special spends entire blood bar deals more damage based on blood spent
 - special cooldown decreases quickly at high blood - not at all at low blood
 - on entering a frenzy, refresh special - increase special cooldown and damage

## dash:

dash_charges:
	perfect
dash_damage:
	perfect
dash_dist_longer:
	perfect
infinite_dash:
	maybe make dash cooldown even lower but dash much faster
mark_dash_upgrade:

wanted upgrades:

overall:
bb_inc_less_blood_gain:
	switched into increase blood effectiveness - greatly increase blood drain
bloodrage_mult_inc:
	perfect - could maybe be split into multiple but also maybe not
blood_at_start:
	perfect
ever_consuming_void:
	perfect - should be nerfed, doubled blood is a lot
high_blood_regen:
	perfect
inc_blood_effect_less_hp:
	perfect
kills_gain_blood_less_hp:
	I dont like it that much but I dont think we should remove it
more_spd_less_blood_gain:
	switched into more speed at low blood

wanted upgrades:
 - when you hit low health, enter a frenzy
 - damage is taken to bloodbar first
 - gain more blood at low blood - but blood drains very quickly at over 60%
 - increased attack and movement speed at low blood - blood effectiveness decreased
 -
